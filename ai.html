      <h1>Types of Wallets</h1>
      <p>There are many different types of wallets available, each with its own set of features and benefits. Here are a few examples:</p>

      <h2>Physical wallets</h2>
      <p>Physical wallets, also known as "hardware wallets," are physical devices that securely store your cryptocurrency offline. They are generally considered to be the most secure way to store cryptocurrency, as they are not connected to the internet and are therefore less vulnerable to hacking. Examples of physical wallets include the Ledger Nano and Trezor.</p>

      <h2>Desktop wallets</h2>
      <p>Desktop wallets are software programs that you can download and install on your computer. They offer a convenient way to store, manage, and trade your cryptocurrency, but are less secure than physical wallets because they are connected to the internet. Examples of desktop wallets include Exodus and Electrum.</p>

      <h2>Mobile wallets</h2>
      <p>Mobile wallets are apps that you can download and use on your smartphone. They offer a convenient way to store and manage your cryptocurrency on the go, but are generally less secure than physical or desktop wallets because they are connected to the internet and can be more easily lost or stolen. Examples of mobile wallets include Coinbase and Mycelium.</p>

      <h2>Paper wallets</h2>
      <p>Paper wallets are a type of "cold storage" method for storing cryptocurrency offline. They consist of a piece of paper with a public and private key printed on them. Paper wallets are secure, but can be easily lost or damaged and are therefore not recommended for long-term storage of large amounts of cryptocurrency.</p>
